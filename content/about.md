title: "About"
---

I work at the intersection of machine learning, AI systems, and applied research, with a focus on building models and systems that operate under real-world constraints.

My work is driven by the idea that model performance alone is insufficient. Decisions around data readiness, evaluation criteria, system architecture, and deployment trade-offs matter as much as the model itself.

## How I work

<div class="card-grid">

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Systems-first thinking</h3>
    <p>
      I approach machine learning as a systems problem, where data, models,
      infrastructure, and operational constraints are tightly coupled.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Robustness over benchmarks</h3>
    <p>
      I prioritize robustness, generalization, and failure modes over
      leaderboard performance.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Ownership and lifecycle</h3>
    <p>
      I emphasize clear ownership across the full ML lifecycle, from data
      readiness to deployment and long-term maintenance.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Pragmatic trade-offs</h3>
    <p>
      I work explicitly with trade-offs between accuracy, latency, cost,
      and maintainability.
    </p>
  </div>

## Background

My background spans research-oriented development, hands-on engineering, and technical leadership.

I have worked end-to-end on applied machine learning systems, from data preparation and experimental validation to deployment and operation in production environments, including resource-constrained settings.

This experience combines academic research training with practical system design and delivery under organizational and operational constraints.

## Scope

<div class="card-grid">

  <div class="card card-emphasis">
    <h3>What I focus on</h3>
    <p>
      Applied machine learning and AI systems intended to be deployed,
      owned, and evolved over time.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>What I avoid</h3>
    <p>
      Prototypes detached from production realities or solutions that
      cannot be sustained beyond initial experimentation.
    </p>
  </div>
