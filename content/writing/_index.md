Technical notes on machine learning engineering and AI systems.

This section includes a weekly series focused on building machine learning concepts from first principles, combining theory, minimal implementations, and system-level considerations.

The goal is not to document tools or APIs, but to clarify how core ideas work, what trade-offs they introduce, and why they matter when systems meet real-world constraints.
