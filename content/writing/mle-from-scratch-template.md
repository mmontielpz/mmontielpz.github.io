This note is part of an ongoing **MLE from scratch** series.

The goal of this series is to revisit core machine learning ideas from first principles, combining theory, minimal implementation, and system-level considerations that matter in practice.

---

## Context

What problem does this technique or algorithm address?

When does it matter in real systems, and when does it not?

---

## Core idea

Explain the intuition behind the method without equations or APIs.

What trade-off does it introduce compared to simpler alternatives?

---

## From scratch

Describe the algorithm or technique starting from first principles.

Use pseudocode or a minimal implementation. Avoid framework-specific abstractions.

```text
# pseudocode or minimal implementation here
````

Focus on clarity over completeness.

---

## System implications

How does this method affect:

* data requirements
* computational cost
* latency or memory
* failure modes in production

---

## Takeaways

* Key idea to remember
* Common misconception or pitfall
* Practical implication for ML systems
